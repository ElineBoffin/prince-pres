# PrincePress - Your Ultimate Anime Bookstore

PrincePress is a web application developed by three passionate frontend developers. It allows users to search for anime books and find out where they can purchase them. The platform also provides a space for users to register, log in, and leave their own reviews and comments on the books they've read.

## Features

* **Anime Book Search**: Users can search for anime books using various filters.
* **Buy Locations**: Once a book is found, users can see where they can purchase it.
* **User Registration and Login**: Registered users can leave their own reviews and comments on the books.

## Challenges and Solutions

One of the main challenges we faced during development was learning and integrating PHP into our project. As we primarily focused on frontend development, we had to quickly learn PHP to handle server-side operations. After spending time understanding the basics of PHP and Laravel, we were able to successfully integrate PHP into our project.

## Future Plans

In the future, we plan to add more features to PrincePress, such as chat functions, book recommendations based on user preferences, and more. We believe that these features will enhance the user experience and make PrincePress a go-to platform for anime book lovers.
